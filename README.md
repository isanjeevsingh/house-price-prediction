# House Price Prediction in Ames, Iowa

## Abstract
In this project, we aim to analyze a house price data set from the city of Ames in Iowa Cook (2011). Primarily, we are interested to know the key factors tightly related to housing prices, eventually leading us to accurately predict the costs based on relevant predictor variables. The involved data set carries seventy-nine predictor variables, with both the mix of categorical and numerical variables. We considered several different models to perform the modeling and got the RMSE of 0.1 on the test data set and 0.127 RMSE on Kaggle. The models we considered in this study were, Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Elastic Net. The best model came out to be XGBoost based on the performance on the test data with no response. Also, the factors that contributed most to predicting the housing prices were 1. Above ground living area, 2. The overall quality of the house, 3. House age.
